# TEAM REPORT

## PREVIOUS WEEK'S GOALS

* Full support of restaurant discovery and favoriting
* Full support of availability selection
* Implementation of user matching
* Skeletal structure for user chatting

## PROGRESS AND ISSUES
* Increased functionality of the restaurant favoriting page
* Created cute restaurant cards for the favoriting page
* Created cute user profile cards
* Updated the home page
* Created an initial framework for the successful matches page
* Created a switch that allows developers to swap between production API calls and local API calls
* Created test data and API documentation that frontend needs for functionality

### Things that worked:

* We now have restaurant data flowing from the Google API to the frontend, then posting to the backend, being processed and then stored in our database. And it's all dynamic and based on user location.  

### Things that did not work:

* SpringBoot testing and Spring Security together

### What we learned:

* Improved clarity and simplicity necessary for processes that build, test, and run.
* Learned how to transfer, store, and render photo data 
* Refined the process for sending data back and forth from the backend to the frontend
* We learned that if your connection string is pointing to the wrong instance, you're gonna have a bad time.

### Where we had trouble:

* Spring Boot integration testing with Spring Security

### Where we were blocked:

* Spring Boot integration testing with Spring Security

## PLANS AND GOALS FOR NEXT WEEK

* Improve simplicity and clarity for new contributors
* Refactor Restaurant representation and data transfer process to eliminate SQL bugs and improve performance
* Work on caching data returned from api calls to improve performance and save resources

### ____________________________________________

### CADE

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week -- 

* Implemented functionality to query photo data from Google Nearby Places API and render it in React
* Implemented functionality for user to favorite restaurants and have it post to the backend and saved to database
* Refactored several back end classes and processes to allow for posting of data to database
* Implemented functionality to return the restaurants the user has favorited from the backend and render to the frontend

-- Progress and Issues --

* More work still needs to be done on the backend because we're getting several bugs due to the way I changed the restaurant representation
* Having issues with multiple renders (~8 per interaction) and I think it's causing some performance problems and changing the way objects are rendered

-- Things I had trouble with--

* Had trouble posting data from the frontend to the back end due to having to change address strings in multiple places but Dan fixed that issue

-- Blocks --

* No blocks, gonna keep working!

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

* Work on caching data returned from API calls so that performance is improved and less resources (money) is spent unnecessarily
* Nail down final representation of restaurants in backend
* Pitch in to help with testing and documentation
* Work with Jasper to integrate the favoriting and nearby restaurants modules
* Change the favoriting process to be in batches by adding restaurants to an array on favoriting and then posting the array to the backend when the user saves

### STEPHEN

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --
  
  * Made user class more modular
  * Made availability REST API methods more modular
  * Implemented backend user profile classes and API

-- Progress and Issues --

  * Was able to automate integration testing for features that do not require interact with Spring Security
  
-- Things I had trouble with--

  * Integration testing for features that require user authentication (Integration Tests and Spring Security are not playing nicely with each other)
  
-- Blocks --

  * Integration Testing Spring Security (not yet figured out how)
  
-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

  * Finish automated implementation of integration testing (hopefully)
  * Simplify process to build, test, and run
  * Implement backend support of chat

### ____________________________________________

### DAN

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --

* Created a plan for a custom chatting system since others were required use of 3rd party databases or the chatting 
system showed an ineptness incomparable to anything else I have ever seen.

* Created a highly detailed API spec for calls relating to the user chatting system

* Developed a sidebar and user cards for the chatting section of the application
    * User cards will sit within the sidebar and will be scrollable using a dynamically shown sidebar
    * User cards contain name, time last sent, message preview, and picture of the user

* Created a file that consolidated all backend API calls
  * Will allow developers to easily switch from the production version of BowlMates to the local development version of BowlMates
  * Will be easier to define and find new API calls for the entirety of the frontend

-- Progress and Issues --

* **All the stuff above**

* Stephen was contacted and he helped me set up an API route to call so I can start testing backend photo posts
  * Still working on posting and settings up an AWS bucket that will let us store photos for the frontend

-- Things I had trouble with --

* No trouble

-- Blocks --

* No blocks

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

* Continue working on posting photos to the backend and then to an AWS Bucket
* 
* Work on completing a react framework that displays chat in chat bubbles according to user data sent from the backend
