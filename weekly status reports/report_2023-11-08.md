# TEAM REPORT

## PREVIOUS WEEK'S GOALS

* Don't panic
* Have front end set up to the point where new users can create accounts and login (beta release)
* HIGH PRIORITY: Figure out how React/server integration
* Getting availability/restaurant data
* Figure out Maps API

## PROGRESS AND ISSUES

### Things that worked:
* US
* Relatively simple to make our webpages
* ANIMATED SIDEBAR
* API connection works both ways
* We have a skeleton to hang meat on now

### Things that did not work:
* SPRING SECURITY
* Work pacing -- should have started earlier
* First time load bugs

### What we learned:
* Spring Security is very stubborn
* About JavaScript stacking problems in making interactive pages
* How to handle HTTP requests on both ends

### Where we had trouble:
* SPRING SECURITY
* Figuring out how to store times (haven't tried completely yet, TBD)
* React auth kit gives us the alpha version instead of a stable version upon installation
* Parsing large amounts of documentation for learning about front end things
* Version control (a little bit)

### Where we were blocked:
* SPRING SECURITY

## PLANS AND GOALS FOR NEXT WEEK
* Better handling of version control
* Create our bug tracker
* Make our user manual
* Get a Google Map on the favorites
* Learn how to use environment variables
* [This is our to-do with more detailed explanations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-pLM1xxcTSCTpY7jvfekCzOhxwAExfkQRLfBgH_-mco/edit)

### STEPHEN

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --
  
  *  Backend API for interface with frontend has been setup

-- Progress and Issues --

  * Handling user authentication with the backend API was difficult to figure out
  * Just today got user authentication following login functional (ie. Users identity is verified, and they can only affect their fields)
  * Have yet to automate testing of frontend / backend interaction (all tests of this so far have been manual)
  * Have yet to automate testing of database interaction (also tested manually so far)
  
-- Things I had trouble with--

  * Steep learning curve for Spring (Boot, Security, all of it)
  * Semi-Frequent merge conflicts (working on better branch structure and practices moving forward)
  
-- Blocks --

  * Handling requests from outside the Spring server (Cross Origin) (eventually solved)
  * Handling user authentication of requests from outside server (solved literally just now)
  
-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

  * Improve automated testing
  * Incorporate style checking in code reviews
  * Work on backend support of user availability and user matching (along with Cade and Tim)
  * Structure branches and improve communication to reduce frequency of merge conflicts
