# TEAM REPORT

## PREVIOUS WEEK'S GOALS

* Don't panic
* Have front end set up to the point where new users can create accounts and login (beta release)
* HIGH PRIORITY: Figure out how React/server integration
* Getting availability/restaurant data
* Figure out Maps API

## PROGRESS AND ISSUES

### Things that worked:
* US
* Relatively simple to make our webpages
* ANIMATED SIDEBAR
* API connection works both ways
* We have a skeleton to hang meat on now

### Things that did not work:
* SPRING SECURITY
* Work pacing -- should have started earlier
* First time load bugs

### What we learned:
* Spring Security is very stubborn
* About JavaScript stacking problems in making interactive pages
* How to handle HTTP requests on both ends

### Where we had trouble:
* SPRING SECURITY
* Figuring out how to store times (haven't tried completely yet, TBD)
* React auth kit gives us the alpha version instead of a stable version upon installation
* Parsing large amounts of documentation for learning about front end things
* Version control (a little bit)

### Where we were blocked:
* SPRING SECURITY

## PLANS AND GOALS FOR NEXT WEEK
* Better handling of version control
* Create our bug tracker
* Make our user manual
* Get a Google Map on the favorites
* Learn how to use environment variables
* [This is our to-do with more detailed explanations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-pLM1xxcTSCTpY7jvfekCzOhxwAExfkQRLfBgH_-mco/edit)

### CADE

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week -- 

Built out registration form for adding restaurants to database via endpoint. Heavily refactored user and
restaurant classes. Figured out how to get currently authenticated user via Spring Security
SecurityContextHolder method. Built out logic for associating favorite restaurants with 
user profiles as well as the logic for retrieving user preferences and all restaurants.


-- Progress and Issues --

Making decent progress on the backend as far as business logic is concerned. Now that Stephen and Tim seem
to have Spring Security figured out and our authentication is working, the business logic for the whole app
should be amongst the first things to be finished.

-- Things I had trouble with--

Spring Security was a real pain to deal with. I wasted a lot of manhours this week trying to write custom
login logic because the built in login functionality seemed to have unpredictable behaviour at times 
and was poorly documented on top of that. This led to a lot of frustration and I had to throw away 
a lot of the stuff I was working on.

-- Blocks --

None now that Spring Security seems to be working. 

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

Assisting in building out the rest of the backend logic. My main mission is going to be
to figure out how to use an API to automatically populate restaurant data for restaurants that 
are in the users vicinity. As a consequence of this I'm also going to have to change how restaurant data
is both stored in the database and also transferred to the front end via endpoint. Also will be
assisting with availability logic and matching algorithm where I'm needed. Will be taking part in
major effort to refactor existing classes and building out additional testing and documentation.

### TIM

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --

* Created a way to recieve http requests from a React frontend to handle the control logic properly. Also implemented a JWT token encoder/ decoder to help with web security issues.

-- Progress and Issues --

* Spring security still persisted to be an issue, but I think it went well towards the end of the week.

-- Things I had trouble with--

* Running React as a local host and sending authentication tokens to a local host server doesn't work. You have to deploy both to a webserver for it to behave correctly. Who knew?

-- Blocks --

* We overcame all issues thankfully.

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

* Now that Spring Security is done and we have a consistent way to connect front end to back end, we need to iron out all back end details including a matching algorithm



### ____________________________________________

### STEPHEN

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --
  
  *  Backend API for interface with frontend has been setup

-- Progress and Issues --

  * Handling user authentication with the backend API was difficult to figure out
  * Just today got user authentication following login functional (ie. Users identity is verified, and they can only affect their fields)
  * Have yet to automate testing of frontend / backend interaction (all tests of this so far have been manual)
  * Have yet to automate testing of database interaction (also tested manually so far)
  
-- Things I had trouble with--

  * Steep learning curve for Spring (Boot, Security, all of it)
  * Semi-Frequent merge conflicts (working on better branch structure and practices moving forward)
  
-- Blocks --

  * Handling requests from outside the Spring server (Cross Origin) (eventually solved)
  * Handling user authentication of requests from outside server (solved literally just now)
  
-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

  * Improve automated testing
  * Incorporate style checking in code reviews
  * Work on backend support of user availability and user matching (along with Cade and Tim)
  * Structure branches and improve communication to reduce frequency of merge conflicts

### ____________________________________________

### DAN

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --

* Set up Continuous Deployment for the backend
* Set up a sidebar and header for the react side of the application
* Create bodies for different pages according to the spec
* Help test a beta that is to be turned in on Tuesday
* Complete a preliminary authorization and authentication service on the frontend
* Set up API integration on the frontend for the restaurants page for the beta

-- Progress and Issues --

* Everything in the goals section completed.
* Frontend skeleton looking great
* Created another container for the backend for deployment
* Upgraded the frontend container service for more processing power


-- Things I had trouble with --

* React-auth-kit was using an alpha version with no documentation instead of the version we wanted and had to downgrade.
* Issues with React Routes going into infinite rendering loops when using protected routes - had to separate some pages.
* Small issues with the sidebar not animating. Pre-styled components must be placed outside react functional components.

-- Blocks --

* No current blocks
* All issues during the week were resolved during this week

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

* Get a google maps pages setup on the restaurant favoriting page
* Get new API integration on restaurant favoriting page
* Refactor frontend webpages to have easier integration with API
* Add authentication to webpages that check for token validity
