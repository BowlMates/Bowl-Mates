### JASPER

### CADE

This week felt like we started to get into the swing of things as a group. I spent the
week getting my individual resources set up to contribute to the project including
getting github desktop installed and renewing my intellij license. Also, I attended various
in person and remote meetings to get our requirements milestone finished and submitted. Overall
I don't feel like anything is blocking me and am eager to start planning the architecture of our product.

### GEOFFREY

### TIM

#### Things that worked:

* Completion of assignments ahead of schedule to allow for later fine tune when needed

* Frequent team communication

#### Things that did not work:

* Initially our use cases didn't follow the examples from class, 
but we were able to quickly resolve this issue

doing all git requests from the command line.

* NA, we were able to resolve all issues as a group

#### Plans And Goals For Next Week

* I plan to follow the schedule set by the group

* Find the specific piece of the architecture/ app I will be working on, so I can prepare
for later aspects of the project
