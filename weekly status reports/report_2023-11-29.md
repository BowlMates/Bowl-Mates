# INDIVIDUAL REPORTS

### JASPER

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --
* Our restaurant finder/favorites page is finally functional!

-- Progress and Issues --
* Successfully merged design and functionality for Cade and my separate implementations of our restaurants/favorites page

-- Things I had trouble with--
* Understanding how changes get pulled in when two people are working on the same thing and trying to glue them together :)
* Got a bad tummy ache from seeing "77 issues" from above trouble, but was able to very quickly resolve said issues once I understood what was happening; there weren't too many conflicts.

-- Blocks --
* Was a little stuck for a few days because we should have sat down to merge our implementations sooner, and I was unsure how to proceed until it got finished -- I think we were both focused on trying to make our individual ones as nice as we could. Balance is important.

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --
* Figure out where I can assist further. It seems like everyone is "in their lane" right now; would like to be delegated tasks
* Finalize final submission writeup with group
* Fine tuning

* Completed the matching algorithm and functionality for approving/ denying


-- Progress and Issues --
* Completed the matching algorithm issue

-- Things I had trouble with--
* We are all using the same database even though we are using different branches and there is some old code
that was inherited in some of the branches. This old code broke the database anytime someone tried to run the 
server. We created a new merge of all branches to resolve this.
