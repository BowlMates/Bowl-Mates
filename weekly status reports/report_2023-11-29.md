# TEAM REPORT

## PREVIOUS WEEK'S GOALS
* Improve simplicity and clarity for new contributors
* Refactor Restaurant representation and data transfer process to eliminate SQL bugs and improve performance
* Work on caching data returned from api calls to improve performance and save resources

## PROGRESS AND ISSUES
* Restaurant finding + favoriting merged
* Restaurant finding + favoriting page fully functional
* Home page is amusing
* 

### Things that worked:
* We now have restaurant data flowing from the Google API to the frontend, then posting to the backend, being processed and then stored in our database. And it's all dynamic and based on user location.  

### Things that did not work:
*

### What we learned:
*

### Where we had trouble:

### CADE

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week -- 

* Worked with Jasper to complete merge of restaurant favorite component and restaurant finder tool
* Improved application performance by implementing conditional calls to the Google API's and memoizing React components/state variables to limit unnecessary rendering
* Added array sort to favorite restaurant array returned by SQL database to ensure they're always in a deterministed render order
* Implemented form validation checks for user Sign Up page as well as the logic which posts new user registration data to the backend
* General bug fixes 


-- Progress and Issues --

* Learned when merging the two front end branches with Jasper that we probably should have been making smaller merges more frequently

-- Things I had trouble with--

* It was really difficult identifying the things that I could do to improve the performance and efficiency of code that I wrote for the front end. It made me realize that while I can write functional React code given enough time I don't have a full grasp on how the code works at a deep level, which I would like to learn more about.

-- Blocks --

* None, let's finish this bad boy!

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

* Implement loading screen or animation for the restaurant finder to hide all the uneven rendering
* Fix LoadingScript bug for Google Maps
* Assist others as they finish their tasks for the final turn in
* Refactor code to send batch updates to the backend if it makes sense for our implementation and we have time
* Add animation to "favoriting" user action for feedback

### TIM

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --
* Completed the matching algorithm and functionality for approving/ denying


-- Progress and Issues --
* Completed the matching algorithm issue

-- Things I had trouble with--
* We are all using the same database even though we are using different branches and there is some old code
that was inherited in some of the branches. This old code broke the database anytime someone tried to run the 
server. We created a new merge of all branches to resolve this.

-- Blocks --
* NA

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --
* Get this thing going!! i.e. have a fully working project
* I will specifically be working on profile pictures
