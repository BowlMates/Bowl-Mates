# TEAM REPORT

## PREVIOUS WEEK'S GOALS
* Improve simplicity and clarity for new contributors
* Refactor Restaurant representation and data transfer process to eliminate SQL bugs and improve performance
* Work on caching data returned from api calls to improve performance and save resources

## PROGRESS AND ISSUES
* Restaurant finding + favoriting merged
* Restaurant finding + favoriting page fully functional
* Home page is amusing

### Things that worked:
* We now have restaurant data flowing from the Google API to the frontend, then posting to the backend, being processed and then stored in our database. And it's all dynamic and based on user location.  

### Things that did not work:
* Spring Security Integration testing still not working

### What we learned:
* Learning how to make and merge branches with minimal issues 

### Where we had trouble:
* Making and merging branches

### Where we were blocked:
* Spring Security integration testing

## PLANS AND GOALS FOR NEXT WEEK
* Have a functional app for our demo

# INDIVIDUAL REPORTS

### JASPER

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --
* Our restaurant finder/favorites page is finally functional!

-- Progress and Issues --
* Successfully merged design and functionality for Cade and my separate implementations of our restaurants/favorites page

-- Things I had trouble with--
* Understanding how changes get pulled in when two people are working on the same thing and trying to glue them together :)
* Got a bad tummy ache from seeing "77 issues" from above trouble, but was able to very quickly resolve said issues once I understood what was happening; there weren't too many conflicts.

-- Blocks --
* Was a little stuck for a few days because we should have sat down to merge our implementations sooner, and I was unsure how to proceed until it got finished -- I think we were both focused on trying to make our individual ones as nice as we could. Balance is important.

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --
* Figure out where I can assist further. It seems like everyone is "in their lane" right now; would like to be delegated tasks
* Finalize final submission writeup with group
* Fine tuning
  

### ____________________________________________

### CADE

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week -- 

* Worked with Jasper to complete merge of restaurant favorite component and restaurant finder tool
* Improved application performance by implementing conditional calls to the Google API's and memoizing React components/state variables to limit unnecessary rendering
* Added array sort to favorite restaurant array returned by SQL database to ensure they're always in a deterministed render order
* Implemented form validation checks for user Sign Up page as well as the logic which posts new user registration data to the backend
* General bug fixes 


-- Progress and Issues --

* Learned when merging the two front end branches with Jasper that we probably should have been making smaller merges more frequently

-- Things I had trouble with--

* It was really difficult identifying the things that I could do to improve the performance and efficiency of code that I wrote for the front end. It made me realize that while I can write functional React code given enough time I don't have a full grasp on how the code works at a deep level, which I would like to learn more about.

-- Blocks --

* None, let's finish this bad boy!

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

* Implement loading screen or animation for the restaurant finder to hide all the uneven rendering
* Fix LoadingScript bug for Google Maps
* Assist others as they finish their tasks for the final turn in
* Refactor code to send batch updates to the backend if it makes sense for our implementation and we have time
* Add animation to "favoriting" user action for feedback

### ____________________________________________

### GEOFFREY

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --
* Figured out how to implement alerts
* Made updates to our user documentation 

-- Progress and Issues --
* Had issues running the frontend for testing but found out that I wasn't running the springboot backend :')

-- Things I had trouble with--
* We encountered a good amount of merge conflicts, but they were resolved

-- Blocks --
* n/a

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --
* Connecting frontend to backend of profile and matches page using API addresses 
* Adding state to the matches page and ensuring that it works with our match algorithm
* Tying up any loose ends on the frontend

### ____________________________________________

### TIM

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --
* Completed the matching algorithm and functionality for approving/ denying


-- Progress and Issues --
* Completed the matching algorithm issue

-- Things I had trouble with--
* We are all using the same database even though we are using different branches and there is some old code
that was inherited in some of the branches. This old code broke the database anytime someone tried to run the 
server. We created a new merge of all branches to resolve this.

-- Blocks --
* NA

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --
* Get this thing going!! i.e. have a fully working project
* I will specifically be working on profile pictures

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --

  * Simplified process to build, test, and run

-- Progress and Issues --

  * Backend support of chat in progress (mostly complete)
  
-- Things I had trouble with--

  * No real headway on Spring Security Integration testing

  * Complete backend support of chat
  * Work with team to seamlessly integrate new features
  * Settle on a testing framework
