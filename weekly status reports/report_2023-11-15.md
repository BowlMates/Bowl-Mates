-- Progress and Issues --
* I finally got to touch the front end this week and I implemented a huge feature, which felt really good
* Had lots of issues integrating the various google api's because none of the Google documentation was for React and many of the libraries were deprecated

-- Things I had trouble with--
* Had many bugs with google maps, including the map no re rendering properly when you navigated away and returned to the page
* Had issue with user location data not updating map correctly because of flow of function calls in app
* Just in general trying to find documentation for deprecated or unsupported libraries was tough

-- Blocks --
* No blocks really

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --
* Extend functionality to favorite restaurants to restaurants retrieved via api call 
* Help backend team put together the matching algorithm and implement with front end
* Help Jasper combine the favorite restaurants tool with the restaurant finder tool

### DAN

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --

* Get API calls defined using example json files so backend team can develop backend calls
* Discuss and define a storage solution for restaurant favoriting integration with backend and database with Cade.
* Refactor frontend code to reduce noncompliance with chosen style guides.
* Start looking into Mirrorfly and possible alternatives.

-- Progress and Issues --

* Handed off Google API integration with restaurant favoriting to Cade. 
* Discovered Mirrorfly's youtube tutorials were horrendous and documentation was bad. Chose to create custom solution.
* Slight trouble developing a custom solution for chat storage, but working with Cade helped define a concrete path to the solution.

-- Things I had trouble with --

* Watching Mirrorfly tutorials.
* Haven't yet completed auth checks for pages and redirects for when the user is logged in.

* No current blockers

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --
