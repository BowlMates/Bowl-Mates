# INDIVIDUAL REPORTS

### JASPER

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --

* Figured out the CI was just fine as it was... For now.
* Updated how the restaurant favorites were being displayed
* Covered the password input for the Signup and Login pages

-- Progress and Issues --

* Reviewed Cade's front end PR and made suggestions
* Updated existing front end code to better suit our needs, as well as adding appropriate comments where necessary

-- Things I had trouble with--

* Had to remove the entire project and re-clone it to get npm start to work properly

-- Blocks --

* Waiting to connect the back end for restaurants to our front end so that I can pull in images for each restaurant's card

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

* Finalize the finding/favoriting restaurants with Cade
* Finally get rid of the hardcoded restaurants list, passing restaurant data in from gMaps
* Add documentation to my existing code
* Sit in on backend discussions to learn about our matching algo, and get thinking about how we'll be implementing connecting our matching algorithm with our front end user cards
  

### ____________________________________________

### CADE

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week -- 

* Implemented Google Maps API into React front end
* Successfully retrieved user location data via browser navigator.geolocation feature
* Successfully made API call to Google Nearby Places (New) to return to the user a list of popular restaurants near them
* Completed Front End code review with Dan
* Reviewed Jasper's front end PR and made suggestions


-- Progress and Issues --
* I finally got to touch the front end this week and I implemented a huge feature, which felt really good
* Had lots of issues integrating the various google api's because none of the Google documentation was for React and many of the libraries were deprecated

-- Things I had trouble with--
* Had many bugs with google maps, including the map no re rendering properly when you navigated away and returned to the page
* Had issue with user location data not updating map correctly because of flow of function calls in app
* Just in general trying to find documentation for deprecated or unsupported libraries was tough

-- Blocks --
* No blocks really

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --
* Extend functionality to favorite restaurants to restaurants retrieved via api call 
* Help backend team put together the matching algorithm and implement with front end
* Help Jasper combine the favorite restaurants tool with the restaurant finder tool
* Figure out how to get restaurant photo data from google api and how to save it in database

### GEOFFREY

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --

* Implemented a UserCard to be used in the matches page
* Created the user manual for Bowlmates and linked it in our site
* Set up a user google form to report bugs and issues
* Made the bug tracker in google sheets that contains form submissions (other bugs are found in GitHub issues)

-- Progress and Issues --

* Made adequate progress on my assigned pages and documentation

-- Things I had trouble with--

* Had trouble authenticating into the app to get started on the frontend but this issue was fixed

-- Blocks --

* Since the backend has not yet setup the data structures to hold user data, I have not yet started on server calls

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

* Add more comments and documentation to my code
* Refactor the code as necessary in order to get it to match style guides
* Add functionality with the backend for user settings. image upload, and matching page
* Have the settings page display the user's own card preview


### ____________________________________________

### TIM

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --

* I helped with generating the documentation for the backend and started implementing the priority queue for the matching algorithm

-- Progress and Issues --

* I'm glad with the progress with the matching algorithm and will be ready to move forward with a final version upon completion of restaurant and availability data.

-- Things I had trouble with--

* Creating Junit tests to access a local host server / send and recieve http requests is very difficult and something I've never encountered before. In the meantime, I've been using postman to test these issues.

-- Blocks --

* We overcame all issues thankfully.

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

* I want to get a working matching algorithm and explore options for handling images in the backend.

### STEPHEN

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --
  
  *  Reviewed all of backend code for style compliance
  *  Implemented backend support of user availability
  *  Structured branches to reduce merge conflicts

  * Still haven't automated integration testing
  * Haven't completed implementation of matching algorithm
  
-- Blocks --

  * None this week
  
-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --

  * Automate integration testing (Lots of reading needed to figure this out)
  * Add backend support for addional misc frontend functions
  * Make user class more modular
  * Make availability REST API methods more modular

### ____________________________________________

### DAN

-- Goals (accomplished) for this past week --

* Get API calls defined using example json files so backend team can develop backend calls
* Discuss and define a storage solution for restaurant favoriting integration with backend and database with Cade.
* Refactor frontend code to reduce noncompliance with chosen style guides.
* Start looking into Mirrorfly and possible alternatives.

-- Progress and Issues --

* Handed off Google API integration with restaurant favoriting to Cade. 
* Discovered Mirrorfly's youtube tutorials were horrendous and documentation was bad. Chose to create custom solution.
* Slight trouble developing a custom solution for chat storage, but working with Cade helped define a concrete path to the solution.

-- Things I had trouble with --

* Watching Mirrorfly tutorials.
* Haven't yet completed auth checks for pages and redirects for when the user is logged in.

-- Blocks --

* No current blockers

-- Plans and Goals for Next Week --
